;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package gives you tabs.
;; But instead of the normal GUI tabs you might think of,
;; it provides a more keyboard-oriented (and visually inadequate) tabs.
;; You can jump to a specific buffer by `nerdtab-jump-<number>'
;; or by clicking the tab.
  
;; `nerdtab-mode' is a global minor mode.
;; Turn it on and it will open a side window and display buffers as tabs for you.

;; Checkout homepage for more information on usage and customizations.
  
;; Note that `nerdtab--' means private, `nerdtab-' means public / customizable (for variables)
